/**
 * Detection related information.
 *
 * <p>The main class in this package is {@code Detection}, which has various modality-specific
 * components.
 *
 * <p>The Detection class specifies a single instance of sensed information, which if hypothesized
 * to be part of a tracked object, serves as evidence of the tracked object. The detections can be
 * reported independent of whether or not they are eventually associated with a track point.
