 *
 * <p>The spatial resolution of a sensor is defined by two measures - ground sampling distance (GSD)
 * and ground resolved distance (GRD). The ground sampling distance is the distance, in field units,
 * between the centres of two neighbouring detectors (i.e. two neighbouring pixels on the image).
