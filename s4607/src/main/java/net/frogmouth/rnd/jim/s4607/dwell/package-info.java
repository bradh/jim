/**
 * Dwell Segment.
 *
 * <p>A Dwell Segment is a report on a grouping of zero or more target reports for which the sensor
 * provides a single time, sensor position, reference position on the ground with simple estimates
 * for the observed area at the reported time, and other pertinent data. A Dwell Segment may be
 * associated with a radar dwell but need not be. The Dwell Segment presents data pertinent to MTI
 * targets. Dwell Segments shall be sent for each logical grouping of target reports. A Dwell
 * Segment is transmitted even if no targets are observed.
